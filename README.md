# Waggle

## Overview
The task here is to create a boardroom paginated report demo that tells the story of how Waggle's new product 'LapCat' compares to the original product 'LapDog' in its new expansion.

#### Business Requests 

The CEO is curious about the following questions:

* Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
* Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

For extras, 

1. The Chief Marketing Officer would like the report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.
2. The product team would like to incorporate other visuals and insights as we see fit but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets
3. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own.
